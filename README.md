# Advent of Code 2018
This is my first year participating in Advent of Code. It was suggesuted to me by my roomate and I figured it would be a fun way to keep my programming skills sharp. Looking at other people's answers on r/adventofcode also really opens your eyes to more efficient (but sometimes less readable) algorithms, methods, or tricks that other poeple implement.

My plan is to solve as many as possible in Python (3) since it has been my go-to scripting language forever. I may opt to switch languages for the sake of learning if solving at some point either this year or in future years.
